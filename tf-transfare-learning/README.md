### Transfare Learning
* Transfer learning is a machine learning method where a model developed for a task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task.

* It is a popular approach in **Deep Learning** where pre-trained models are used as the starting point on computer vision and natural language processing tasks given the vast compute and time resources required to develop neural network models on these problems and from the huge jumps in skill that they provide on related problems.

#### Examples of Transfer Learning with Deep Learning:
1. **Transfer Learning with Image Data**
    Examples of pretrained models include:
    *  ImageNet 
    *  Oxford VGG Model
    *  Google Inception Model
    *  Microsoft ResNet Model
    
2. **Transfer Learning with Language Data**  
    Examples of pretrained models include:
    * Google’s word2vec Model
    * Stanford’s GloVe Model
